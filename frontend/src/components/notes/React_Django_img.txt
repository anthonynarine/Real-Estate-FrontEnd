React willl not be able to display images because
the general development server dosen't serve media 
files by default. This issue will be handled on 
the django side. 

The static files of the application must be served  
this is located in the django admin panel. 


below is the django setup
# Serving files (images) uploaded by a user during development

    #imports    
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

    add this code after the urlspatterns array
    + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
    as shown below

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("api/listings/", listings_views.ListingList.as_view()),   
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)


We also need to serve the static files of the application since the front end is 
handled by react. 

         in setting.py file 

STATIC_URL = "static/"
# ADDED -> STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")
MEDIA_URL = "/media/"
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "media")


add this code after the urlspatterns array
+ static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
as shown below

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("api/listings/", listings_views.ListingList.as_view()),   
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT) #ADDED-> + static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
