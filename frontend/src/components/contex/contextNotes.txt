1. context is used when we want to make data available to all children components.

2. The provider component comes with every context object and is what allows us 
    to pass the data down. see app.js for use case. 

3. context.Provider comes with a value property which we will give the data 
    we want to pass down in this case it's dispatch. (see app.js) 


4. the above 3 steps are followed for state.  making the state and dispatch objects
    available to all children components of the app component.
