The post request will require the URL and DATA we are sending.

               1. URL setup (make sure to see djoser docs)
djoser documentation for current url and setup for post request
https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_endpoints.html

    Default URL: /users/

the base url is taken from django projects settings url patterns. 
api-auth-djoser as per the djoser docs add /users/

    "api-auth-djoser/users/" this is now preceeded by http://localhost:8000

    http://localhost:8000/"api-auth-djoser/users/"



               2. DATA setup (make sure to see djoser docs)

                This functionality will be added to this project. 
     re_password is only required if USER_CREATE_PASSWORD_RETYPE is True

        data will be an object with key value pairs
                  {
          username: "usernameValue",
          email: "emailValue",
          password: "passwordValue",
          re_password: "password2Value",
        },

    NOTE djoser require that the key for a password confirmation 
         must be re_password (see docs post request)

         3. Adding password confirmarion to project settings.py files 
            djoser settings page will provide necessary code.  
            
        DJOSER = {
            "USER_CREATE_PASSWORD_RETYPE" : True,
            "SEND_ACTIVATION_EMAIL": False,
        }
            
            The above 2 key value pairs were taken from 
            https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html#user-create-password-retype
