 REMEMBER TO ADD A VIEW IN THE BACKEND: THIS PROJECTS BACKEND VIEW TO DELETE BELOW (LISTING APP)


 the request will pair with a conditinally rendered button with a function call as shown below.
 here if the user id and seller id are the same then the button will be rendered and the 
 logged in user will have the option to delete the listing from the listing detail page. 

 {GlobalState.userId == state.listingInfo.seller ? ( 
    <Grid item container justifyContent="space-" xs={4}>
        <Button onClick={handleDelete}>delete</Button>
    </Grid>) : ""}
